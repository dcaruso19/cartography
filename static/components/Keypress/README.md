**What's new**
---------------

1.0.8

* Ensure that on_release is called for all combos, not just counting combos.
* Fix bug that was causing is_ordered to be ignored.
* Fixed an edge case for a counting combo's count not being reset.
* Improve how key events are bound

1.0.7

* Fixed combo matching to prevent performance issues as more keys are pressed.

1.0.6

* Fixed a bug with exclusive combos not properly excluding each other in some cases.
* Feature added to allow for combos that do not fire if unrelated keys are also pressed ("is_solitary" boolean).



TODO
----

* Put negative edge in sequences.
* See if we can do away with keyup_fired and count properties.
